"""One place where this pipeline talks to Claude.

`digest_generator`, `fact_checker` and `trends` each grew their own copy of the
same call — model string, cache breakpoints, and a continuation loop for when a
response hits `max_tokens`. Two of the three copies drifted: `trends` never got
the retry and never got prompt caching, despite sending the largest payload of
the three (a whole new digest plus a whole previous one plus the topic memory).

Reading the response is the part that has to be right. Under adaptive thinking
the first content block is a *thinking* block, so the old `response.content[0].text`
would have returned the wrong thing — or raised — the moment the model changed.
`text_of` walks the blocks instead.
